# steam_skin_flipping
This python script was made using Selenium. It's main goal is to scrape data from the pages specified by the user. The script will get the price and quantity of Steam skins sales and see if it would be profitable for the user to flip. It will write the data to a .txt file. The script is relatively complex, made to work with any steam exception.
